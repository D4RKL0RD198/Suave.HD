Suave HD 6 By: Pat974, D4RKL0RD198, The Raptor, Bli625, Finkle316
I am still using Pat974's original GUI I have only modified it to work with iOS6.X and iPhone 5. I have all of the GUI finished up so that everybody enjoys it this time around as it is now using grey & black to match the rest of the GUI. I have a way to Auto-Theme small app icons so the settings app and everywhere else in iOS that uses small icons does not have that black boarder that I have seen people having problems with.

I have now fully themed every part of the Auxo switcher with the help of The Raptor's PSD's

[u][b]Music & Video Apps[/b][/u]
The Music app and anything that uses the media player resources has been fixed up (the faint white line at the top of the music app is the movement sensor GUI but that isn't of concern)

[u][b]General GUI and Other Stock Apps[/b][/u]
I have fixed the "app well lock" slider so it fits the small app icons for lockscreen notifications and I have also fixed the slider to work with the "well lock" image.
